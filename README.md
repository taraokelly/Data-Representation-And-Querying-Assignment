**TheFeed**

I chose to create a blogging website as my single web-page application, as I thought it would provide a good demonstration of data representation and querying. The way I intended to deploy TheFeed would involve routing, which was a strong component in the project requirements. 

**Goals:**

- [x] Login/Sign up page
- [x] Home page displaying all user posts
- [x] Profile page showing current user posts 
- [x] Search bar to search users or tags
- [x] Settings page
- [x] Logout functionality

**Technologies**:

*Python3 and Flask
  *I used Python3 and Flask, a microframework for Python based on Werkzeug and Jinja2, for the server-side scripting. I used the @app.route decorator to map the URL to functions in my Flask App. I then used the Jinja2 template engine to render new templates when the functions mapped to @app.route decorator is called.

*HTML and Bootstrap
  *For the client side I used HTML and jQuery. I used Bootstap to create responsive designs in my HTML pages.
